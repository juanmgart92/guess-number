# Game of Riddle of Numbers ðŸ“Ÿ

This project implements a simple number guessing game in JavaScript for a basic web application. Players try to guess a randomly generated secret number in the range of 1 to 10. The user interface provides clues as to whether the number entered is greater or less than the secret. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the secret number. In addition, the code includes an additional function (`numBiggestSmaller`) that finds the largest and smallest number in a given array.
